CS2812: OOP 2 Assignment 2

Personal Picnic Food Plan Generator 🥪📝


Overview
The goal of this assignment is to implement a program that generates personalised lists of food items, including fruits, cheeses, wine, and soft drinks, to make up a picnic that you are planning for the beginning of Spring. It takes an input word (e.g. a person's name) as its argument and creates a list of picnic items in which the first letter(s) of each item spell the given word.

For instance, the program could run as follows:

    $ java PicnicPanner Tommy
    
    Tangelo
    
    Olivet cendre (cheese)
    
    Monte del frà custoza superiore cà del magro (wine)
    
    Mulberry
    
    Yorkshire blue (cheese)
